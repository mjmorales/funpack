# funpack artifact format — v1

This document is the **process-boundary data contract** between `funpack` (the
pure `source → artifact` compiler) and the **runtime** (the impure native
executor, Odin, `runtime/**`). It is the spec-§29 Unix seam: a versioned byte
format plus a written layout, **not** a library link. A runtime parses the bytes
from *this document alone*, with **zero `funpack` imports** — nothing in
`funpack/**` is on the runtime's include path.

The artifact is the **serialized checked AST** of one game. Spec §09 §1 makes the
on-disk spelling (checked-AST vs. bytecode) an implementation detail of the
interpreter's canonical semantics; the checked AST is the cheapest loadable form,
so that is what this format carries. The runtime interprets it; this format does
not encode evaluation order beyond the pipeline's total order.

A golden fixture conforming to this v1 layout lives at
[`../testdata/pong.artifact`](../testdata/pong.artifact). The production emitter
(a later story) must reproduce that fixture **byte-for-byte** from
`examples/pong/`.

---

## 1. Versioning rule — exact match, no best-effort

The first line of every artifact is the schema stamp:

```
funpack-artifact 1
```

- `schema_version` is the integer after the space (here `1`).
- **Any** change to a section, field, ordering, or encoding **bumps the version**
  — there are no optional fields and no minor/compatible tier.
- A runtime reads the stamp and **refuses a mismatch**: it loads only the exact
  version it was built for and rejects every other with a fix-it diagnostic,
  never a best-effort parse. An under- or over-shaped artifact is an error. This
  mirrors the Index Contract's exact-match discipline (§29 §2): the schema
  version is the single compatibility gate.

The version stamp is line 1 so a parser can reject a wrong version before reading
any payload.

---

## 2. Purity — bit-identical by construction

The artifact carries **no host nondeterminism** (§09, §29):

- **No clock** — no timestamps, build dates, or wall-clock anywhere.
- **No machine paths** — source spans are recorded as the **path-derived module
  name** (§15) plus a 1-based line, never an absolute or cwd-relative filesystem
  path.
- **No float** — every `Fixed` is stored as its **raw signed Q32.32 `i64` bits**
  in decimal (§2.3). There is no decimal-string round-trip, so emission and load
  are exact and identical on every machine.
- **No map iteration** — every list in this format is in a **defined total
  order** (declaration order, or the depth-first flattened pipeline order),
  never hash order.

Two emissions from the same source are therefore byte-identical: the format has
no field whose value depends on when, where, or on which machine it was emitted.

### 2.1 Lexical frame

- Encoding is **UTF-8**. Every line ends with a single `\n` (LF, `0x0A`); there
  is no `\r`, no trailing whitespace, and the file ends with a final `\n`.
- The format is **line-oriented**: one record per line. A record is a
  **kind tag** followed by space-separated fields:
  `KIND field1 field2 …`.
- Fields never contain a raw space, `\n`, or `\t` except inside a **string field**
  (§2.4), which is length-prefixed so a parser never scans for a delimiter inside
  it.
- A **section** is a `[section_name N]` header line stating the section name and
  its exact **top-level record count** `N`, followed by `N` top-level records.
- A top-level record may be **variable-length**: it is followed by a run of
  **sub-records** (e.g. `enum Side - 2` is followed by 2 `variant` lines; `thing
  Paddle false 1 5` is followed by 1 `gtag` and 5 `field` lines; a `function`/
  `behavior` record is followed by its `param`/`emit`/… lines **and** its body
  `node` run, §2.7). A **section body runs to the next `[` header** — header lines
  are the only line class that opens with `[`, so a parser reads a section's body
  unambiguously, then re-derives `N` by counting the **lead** lines (those whose
  keyword is *not* a sub-record keyword). The closed sub-record keyword set is:
  `variant`, `field`, `gtag`, `param`, `emit`, `producer`, `consumer`, `set`,
  `node`. A declared `N` that disagrees with the lead-line count is an error (an
  under- or over-shaped section, §29-style exact-match).

  This **lead-line reader is the single parse discipline** for top-level record
  boundaries: a top-level record runs from its lead line up to the next lead line
  (or the next `[` header). Per-record scalar count fields (`param_count`,
  `emits_count`, `body_count`, an enum's `variant_count`) tell a reader how to
  shape each sub-record run *within* a record — but the **record count `N`** is
  always the lead-line count, never a sum of declared sub-counts. The format does
  **not** offer a second, grammar-only reader that derives `N` from declared
  sub-counts: a `const`'s body `node` run and a record's mixed `param`/`emit`/
  `node` sub-records are not all reachable from a single declared sub-count on the
  lead line, so only the lead-line discipline is sound. `node` being a sub-record
  keyword keeps every body line a sub-record, so the lead-line count is exact.

### 2.2 Integer encoding (`Int`)

A funpack `Int` is a 64-bit signed saturating integer (§10). It is written in
**decimal**, with a leading `-` for negatives, no leading zeros (except the value
`0`), no `+`, no thousands separators. Range is `[-9223372036854775808,
9223372036854775807]`.

### 2.3 Fixed encoding (`Fixed`)

A funpack `Fixed` is signed Q32.32 (`i64` raw, §10). It is written as its **raw
`i64` bits in decimal** — i.e. `value * 2^32`, truncated to the integer that the
compiler's fixed-point lowering produced. Examples (these are the exact bits the
golden fixture carries):

| Source literal | Raw Q32.32 bits |
|---|---|
| `0.0` | `0` |
| `0.5` | `2147483648` |
| `1.0` | `4294967296` |
| `2.0` | `8589934592` |
| `3.0` | `12884901888` |
| `4.0` | `17179869184` |
| `8.0` | `34359738368` |
| `16.0` | `68719476736` |
| `40.0` | `171798691840` |
| `60.0` | `257698037760` |
| `70.0` | `300647710720` |
| `80.0` | `343597383680` |
| `90.0` | `386547056640` |
| `120.0` | `515396075520` |
| `152.0` | `652835028992` |
| `160.0` | `687194767360` |
| `-70.0` | `-300647710720` |

To recover the logical value, a runtime divides the raw bits by `2^32` in its own
fixed-point representation; it never parses a decimal point. A `Fixed` field is a
plain decimal integer, lexically indistinguishable from an `Int` field — the
field's **position** (per the record's documented signature) tells the parser
which it is.

### 2.4 String encoding (`String`)

A string field is **length-prefixed**: `Lbyte_count:raw_bytes`. `byte_count` is
the decimal UTF-8 byte length; the bytes follow the `:` verbatim, including any
space or `\n` they contain. A parser reads `byte_count` then consumes exactly that
many bytes — it never interprets the contents. The empty string is `L0:`.

Example: the doc string `Move the paddle` (15 bytes) is `L15:Move the paddle`.

### 2.5 Bool encoding

`true` or `false`, lowercase, as bare tokens.

### 2.6 Identifier / name fields

A name (module, type, field, behavior, stage, enum, variant, signal, function) is
a bare UTF-8 token with no spaces. Qualified names use `.` as the segment
separator (`engine.math`, `Side::Left` uses `::` for an enum variant).

### 2.7 Body encoding — the serialized checked-AST node line

Every executable body the runtime must interpret — each `fn` body, each behavior
`step` body, each `const` initializer, the `bindings()` body, and the `setup()`
body — is serialized **into** the artifact as a tree of checked-AST nodes. The
runtime parses pong from this document with **zero `funpack` imports** and **no
`funpack` source on disk**, so a body cannot be a span reference into source the
runtime can never read: the artifact carries the whole node graph and the runtime
interprets it directly (§09 §1 — the interpreter is the canonical semantics).

A body is a flat, **pre-order** (depth-first, node-then-children) run of `node`
lines. Each node is exactly one line:

```
node KIND field… child_count
```

- `node` is the line's sub-record keyword (it is in the closed
  `SUB_RECORD_KEYWORDS` set, §2.1), so a body run is read by the same lead-line
  discipline as every other sub-record.
- `KIND` is a closed node-kind tag (the table below).
- `field…` are that kind's **scalar** fields in the documented order, each a
  primitive (`Int` §2.2, `Fixed` §2.3, `String` §2.4, name §2.6) — never a nested
  node.
- `child_count` is the **last** field on every node line: the count of immediately
  following `node` lines that are this node's children, in their documented order.
  A reader consumes the node, reads its scalar fields, then recursively consumes
  exactly `child_count` child subtrees. The encoding is therefore total and
  count-driven — a reader never looks ahead past a node's own declared children.
  The **one exception** is the `arm` node (below): an `arm` always has 0 children
  and its trailing field is a variable-length `binders` list (sized by its
  `binder_count` scalar), so `arm`'s child count is fixed at 0 by its kind rather
  than read as a trailing token. Every other node ends in `child_count`.

The node-kind set is closed (a new kind is a schema-version bump, §1) and mirrors
the checked surface AST (spec §02 §5–§6). Children are listed **in evaluation /
source order**; a node's `child_count` plus the kinds below fully determine the
subtree shape:

| KIND | Scalar fields | Children (in order) | Surface form |
|---|---|---|---|
| `int` | `value:Int` | 0 | integer literal `0` |
| `fixed` | `bits:Fixed` | 0 | fixed literal `4.0` (raw Q32.32, §2.3) |
| `name` | `ident:name` | 0 | a bare name `self`, `BOARD`, `add_goal` |
| `field` | `member:name` | 1 = receiver | field access `a.b` |
| `call` | (none) | 1 + N = callee then N args | `f(a, b)` |
| `variant` | `type:name` `case:name` `has_payload:Bool` | N = payload args | `Side::Left`, `Option::Some(x)` |
| `record` | `type:name` `field_count:Int` `child_count:Int` | `child_count` = `field_count` `recfield` nodes (one per field) | `Vec2{x: …, y: …}` |
| `recfield` | `name:name` | 1 = the field's value subtree | one `name: value` pair inside a `record`/`with` |
| `with` | `field_count:Int` `child_count:Int` | `child_count` = `1 + field_count`: the base value, then `field_count` `recfield` nodes | `value with { f: v }` |
| `list` | `len:Int` | `len` element subtrees | `[a, b]`, `[]` |
| `lambda` | `param_count:Int` `params:name…` | 1 = the single-`return` body expr | `fn(p) { return e }` |
| `unary` | `op:name` | 1 = operand | `-x`, `not x` (`op` ∈ `neg`,`not`) |
| `binary` | `op:name` | 2 = lhs, rhs | `a + b` (`op` table below) |
| `match` | `arm_count:Int` `child_count:Int` | `child_count` = 1 scrutinee + (per arm: an `arm` then its body) = `1 + 2*arm_count` | `match e { … }` |
| `arm` | `pat:name` `type:name` `case:name` `binder_count:Int` `binders:name…` | 0 (fixed by kind; no trailing `child_count`) | one match arm's pattern (its body is the following sibling) |
| `let` | `name:name` | 1 = the bound value expr | `let n = e` |
| `if_return` | (none) | 2 = condition, returned value | early-return `if cond { return v }` |
| `return` | (none) | 1 = the returned value expr | `return e` |

- `binary` `op` is the closed glyph set, by name: `add` `sub` `mul` `div` `mod`
  `eq` `ne` `lt` `le` `gt` `ge` `and` `or`. `unary` `op` is `neg` or `not`.
- `arm` `pat` is the pattern kind: `wildcard` (`type`/`case` are `-`,
  `binder_count` 0), `bare_variant` (`type::case`, `binder_count` 0), or
  `variant_binds` (`type::case` with `binder_count` payload binder names following
  on the same line — a binder of `_` is the discard binder). An `arm` carries no
  child of its own; the arm's body is the **next** sibling subtree under the
  `match`. A `match` therefore declares a `child_count` of `1 + 2*arm_count`: the
  scrutinee subtree, then for each arm an `arm` node immediately followed by its
  body subtree. (For pong every match is two-armed, so `arm_count` is `2` and
  `child_count` is `5`.)
- A body's **top** is a single statement subtree per body line of the source: a
  `fn`/`step`/`const` body is a sequence of statements (`let`, `if_return`,
  `return`), so the owning record declares a `body_count` of top-level statement
  subtrees and the run is those subtrees back-to-back (§9, §10). A `const`
  initializer and the `setup`/`bindings` bodies are a single top-level statement.

Example — `goal_side`'s body (`if at.x < 0.0 { return Option::Some(Side::Right) }`
then `if at.x > BOARD.w { … }` then `return Option::None`) serializes to three
top-level statement subtrees, the first being:

```
node if_return 2
node binary lt 2
node field x 1
node name at 0
node fixed 0 0
node variant Option Some true 1
node variant Side Right false 0
```

The `if_return` declares 2 children (condition, value); the `binary lt` declares 2
(`at.x`, `0.0`); the `field x` declares 1 (its receiver `at`); the literals and
the leaf `variant Side Right` declare 0. A reader rebuilds the tree by consuming
exactly each node's declared child count, with no source and no lookahead.

---

## 3. Top-level layout

The artifact is the version stamp, then these sections **in this fixed order**.
Each is a `[name N]` header followed by `N` records. A runtime reads them
sequentially; the order is part of the contract.

```
funpack-artifact 1
[meta 2]
…
[enums N]
…
[data N]
…
[signals N]
…
[things N]
…
[functions N]
…
[behaviors N]
…
[pipeline_flattened N]
…
[signal_routing N]
…
[setup N]
…
[bindings N]
…
[entrypoint 1]
…
```

Sections with no records still emit their header with `N = 0` and no body lines,
so a parser always reads a fixed sequence of headers.

---

## 4. `[meta]` — project identity

Two records, in order:

```
project NAME           # the §14 project.fcfg block label (package identity)
version L5:0.1.0       # the project.fcfg `version` value, as a String field
```

This is `(project.fcfg)` identity only (§14 §4): name + version. It carries no
build clock and no platform — platform is a build-driver concern (§14 §6), not an
artifact field.

---

## 5. `[enums]` — sum types and role kinds (§03 §2, §03 §4)

One record per declared enum, in source-declaration order. Each enum record is
followed by one `variant` record per variant, in declaration order:

```
enum NAME KIND variant_count
variant NAME PAYLOAD
…
```

- `KIND` is the §03 §4 role kind ascribed after the type name, or `-` for none:
  one of `Axis`, `Button`, `CollisionLayer`, `Num`, `-`. A `Steer: Axis` enum
  records `Axis`; a plain `Side` enum records `-`. The kind is type-constitutive
  (only an `Axis`-kinded enum binds to an analog input, §23), so it travels with
  the enum.
- `PAYLOAD` is the variant shape: `unit` (no payload, e.g. `Side::Left`),
  `tuple K` (K positional types — the type names follow on the same line), or
  `struct K` (K named fields `name:Type` follow). Pong's enums are all `unit`.

---

## 6. `[data]` — value records with field defaults (§03 §1, §08)

One `data` record per `data` declaration, in source order, each followed by its
fields. Every field carries its declared type and its default-presence flag:

```
data NAME field_count mut
field NAME TYPE DEFAULT
…
```

- `mut` is `true` when the type was declared `mut data` (§03 §7), else `false`.
- `field` records carry: the field `NAME`, its `TYPE` (a name; a generic is
  written `Ctor[Arg]`, e.g. `Ref[Switch]`, `[Goal]` for a list), and `DEFAULT`.
- `DEFAULT` is `-` when the field has no default (it must be supplied at every
  literal), or `=ENCODED` where `ENCODED` is the default value in this format's
  primitive encoding (a `Fixed`, `Int`, `Bool`, or `String` per §2; a composite
  default is its constructor record inline — pong has none). A defaulted field may
  be omitted from a literal (§03 §1), so the runtime applies `DEFAULT` when a
  `setup` Spawn omits it.

`Board` is the one pong `data` type; `BOARD` is a module-level `let`, recorded in
`[functions]` as a `const` (§9) since it is a named value, not a type.

---

## 7. `[signals]` — the cross-thing message values (§03 §6)

A `signal` is a `data` value declared with the `signal` keyword — the sole
cross-thing channel (§06 §5). One record per signal, same field grammar as
`[data]` (§6), but `mut` is always `false` (a signal is per-tick, never mutated):

```
signal NAME field_count
field NAME TYPE DEFAULT
…
```

Pong's one signal is `Goal { side: Side }`.

---

## 8. `[things]` — stateful entities with their blackboard schema (§06, §08)

One record per `thing` / `singleton`, in source order, each followed by its
blackboard schema (its `data` fields) and its `@gtag` set:

```
thing NAME SINGLETON gtag_count field_count
gtag L4:ball
field NAME TYPE DEFAULT
…
```

- `SINGLETON` is `true` for a `singleton` (§06 §2, a guaranteed-single-row thing
  spawned once before tick 0, accessed by type), `false` for a `thing`.
- `gtag` records (§05 registry, §14 §4) carry one registered tag each, as a
  String field, in source order. An unregistered tag never reaches the artifact —
  it is a compile error upstream.
- `field` records are the §6 field grammar: name, type, default. A defaulted
  field (`Scoreboard.left = 0`) records its default so a Spawn may omit it.

Pong's things: `Paddle`, `Ball`, `Scoreboard` (all `thing`; pong models the
score as a once-spawned `thing` in `setup`, not a `singleton`).

---

## 9. `[functions]` — pure helpers, module constants, and bindings/setup heads (§02)

One record per module-level `fn`, `let`, the `bindings()` function, and the
`setup()` function, in source order. The function **body** is the serialized
checked AST, carried **in** the record as a run of `node` lines (§2.7) — never a
span reference into source the runtime can never read. The record opens with the
signature and a body statement count; the `param` lines and the `node` body run
follow:

```
function NAME KIND param_count return:TYPE body_count span:MODULE:LINE
param NAME TYPE
…
node …
…
```

- `KIND` is one of: `fn` (a pure helper, e.g. `advance`, `goal_side`), `const`
  (a module-level `let`, e.g. `BOARD` — `param_count` is 0 and `return` is the
  value's type), `bindings` (the one §23 `fn() -> Bindings`), `startup` (the one
  §06 Startup head, `setup() -> [Spawn]`).
- `return:TYPE` is the declared return type (a name or generic per §2.6; `[Goal]`
  for a signal list, `[Spawn]` for the setup command list, `Bindings` for the
  binding head, `Option[Side]` for an option).
- `body_count` is the number of **top-level statement subtrees** in the body
  (§2.7): one per source statement line (`let`/`if_return`/`return`). A `const`
  initializer and the `bindings`/`setup` bodies are a single top-level `return`
  subtree, so their `body_count` is `1`. The body `node` run follows the `param`
  lines and is exactly those statement subtrees back-to-back, in source order.
- `span:MODULE:LINE` is the §15 module name and 1-based source line, kept as
  **diagnostic provenance** — never a filesystem path (§2 purity) and never the
  sole body representation. A runtime executes the carried `node` tree; the span
  only locates the construct in a diagnostic.
- `param` records carry each parameter's name and type, in declaration order.

The `const` record for `BOARD` carries its initializer as the body `node` run
(here a single `return` of a `Board{ w: 160.0, h: 120.0 }` record), so the runtime
evaluates the constant from the artifact alone — a default or a Spawn that reads
`BOARD.w` / `BOARD.h` resolves against the interpreted constant, no source needed:

```
function BOARD const 0 return:Board 1 span:pong:19
node return 1
node record Board 2 2
node recfield w 1
node fixed 687194767360 0
node recfield h 1
node fixed 515396075520 0
```

---

## 10. `[behaviors]` — transitions keyed to their pipeline stage (§06 §3, §06 §6)

One record per `behavior`, in **source-declaration order** (the stable order the
node-check ran in). Each carries the stage slot it occupies, its reserved-step
signature, and its `@gtag` set:

```
behavior NAME on:THING stage:STAGE contract:CONTRACT gtag_count param_count emits_count body_count
gtag L4:ball
param NAME TYPE
…
emit TYPE
…
node …
…
```

- `on:THING` is the §06 §3 owning thing whose blackboard this behavior writes.
- `stage:STAGE` is the pipeline stage slot the behavior is listed in
  (`control`, `collision`, `scoring`, `render`, `startup`) — the slot **confers**
  the contract (§06 §6).
- `contract:CONTRACT` is the engine-closed §06 §6 contract conferred by that slot:
  one of `Update`, `Render`, `Ui`, `Audio`, `Startup`. `paddle_move` is `Update`;
  `draw_ball` is `Render`.
- The **reserved step signature**: every behavior's per-tick entry point is the
  built-in `step` (§06 §3) — not a user-chosen name — so the artifact records the
  signature of `step`, not a name. `param` records are `step`'s parameters **in
  order**: `self` (the blackboard, type = `on:THING`), then resources (`Input`,
  `Time`), inbound signal lists (`[Goal]`), and read-only views (`View[Paddle]`).
  Its parameters are its reads (§06 §3).
- `emit` records are `step`'s return-side emissions: the blackboard type it writes
  (always its own `on:THING`, or absent for a pure Render that returns only
  `[Draw]`), the signal lists `[S]` it emits, and the command lists (`[Draw]`,
  `[Spawn]`) it returns. Its return is its writes (§06 §3). `emits_count` is the
  count of `emit` records.
- `body_count` is the number of **top-level statement subtrees** in `step`'s body
  (§2.7), one per source statement line. The body `node` run (§2.7) follows the
  `emit` lines and is exactly those statement subtrees back-to-back, in source
  order — the runtime interprets it as the behavior's per-tick transition, with no
  `funpack` source on its path. `wall_bounce`'s body, for instance, is two
  statements (`if self.pos.y <= 0.0 or … { return self with { vel: … } }`, then
  `return self`), so its `body_count` is `2`.

A behavior with no `param` beyond `self` and no `emit` beyond its blackboard is
dead code (§06 §6 Update "must write or emit *something*") — that is an upstream
gate, never an artifact state.

---

## 11. `[pipeline_flattened]` — the one total order (§07 §2, §07 §3)

The pipeline is funpack's schedule: an explicit, ordered plan for a tick where
**stage order is its meaning** (§07). A pipeline tree is flattened **depth-first**
into one total order (§07 §3). This section records that flattened order as a flat
sequence — pong's `Pong` pipeline has no sub-pipelines, so the flattening is the
five named stages in order, each expanded to its behaviors in listed order:

```
step ORDINAL stage:STAGE behavior:NAME
```

- `ORDINAL` is the 0-based position in the **total order** — the index a tick's
  fold (§07 §4) visits this step at. It is contiguous and gap-free.
- `stage:STAGE` is the owning stage name (documentary; its position is the
  contract, §07 §1).
- `behavior:NAME` is the behavior run at this step. A behavior referenced here
  must have a `[behaviors]` record (§10).

This is the derived, never-drifting flattened tree (§07 §3): effect closure
(§12's routing) runs on the same order, so the order recorded here **is** the
order the runtime folds. `startup:` steps (run once before tick 0, §07 §1) are
recorded first with `stage:startup`; the interior Update stages
(`control`, `collision`, `scoring`) follow; the terminal `render:` projection
stage is last.

---

## 12. `[signal_routing]` — producer(s) → consumer(s) map (§07 §2, §07 §3)

The derived `signal → producer(s) → consumer(s)` routing map (§07 §3). One record
per signal type that is emitted or consumed anywhere, in signal-declaration order.
Producers and consumers are listed by **flattened-order ordinal** (§11) so the
runtime can verify forward flow without re-deriving it:

```
route SIGNAL producer_count consumer_count
producer ORDINAL behavior:NAME
…
consumer ORDINAL behavior:NAME
…
```

**Effect closure** (§07 §2) holds iff every signal has ≥1 consumer at an ordinal
**strictly greater** than at least one producer's ordinal (the consumer is
downstream in the flattened order). The artifact records the routing; the runtime
may re-check closure against it, but the upstream gate already guaranteed it. For
pong, `Goal` is produced by `score` (in `scoring`) and consumed by `tally` and
`serve` (also `scoring`, but later in the listed order, so downstream).

---

## 13. `[setup]` — the Startup `[Spawn]` program (§06 §6, §07 §4)

The Startup behavior's `[Spawn]` command list, fully evaluated to concrete
encoded values — the deterministic batch applied at the tick boundary before tick
0 (§07 §4). The setup program carries **no expressions**; every field is a
primitive-encoded value (§2), so the runtime spawns the initial population without
interpreting an initializer:

```
spawn THING field_count
set FIELD =ENCODED
…
```

- `spawn THING` names the thing type being spawned, in the **source list order**
  of the `setup()` body (Paddle P1, Paddle P2, Ball, Scoreboard).
- `set FIELD =ENCODED` carries each supplied field's value in this format's
  encoding: an enum variant as `Side::Left` (a name field, §2.6), a `Fixed` as its
  raw bits (§2.3), an `Int` in decimal (§2.2), a `Vec2` as a nested
  `vec2 x_bits y_bits` record. A field omitted in the source (relying on a
  default, §6) is **not** emitted here — the runtime applies the type's default.

This is the §07 §4 fixed-population batch: population is fixed within a tick, and a
thing spawned this tick is first queryable next tick.

## 14. `[bindings]` — the §23 axis/button source map

The `bindings()` function's resolved binding table (§23 §3) — the **only**
device-aware data in the artifact. One record per `.axis(…)` / `.button(…)` call,
in **source-call order** (bindings stack, §23 §3, so order is preserved):

```
bind axis PLAYER ACTION source:SOURCE
bind button PLAYER ACTION source:SOURCE
```

- `axis` / `button` is the binding's analog/digital kind, matching the action's
  §03 §4 role kind (`Axis` → `axis`, `Button` → `button`).
- `PLAYER` is the `PlayerId` (`P1`..`P4`), a name field.
- `ACTION` is the enum variant the binding targets (`Steer::Move`), a name field.
- `source:SOURCE` is the device source, recorded as the builder call that produced
  it: `keys_axis(Key::W,Key::S)`, `stick_y(Stick::Left)` — the device names
  (§23 §3) appear **only here**, never in sim logic. Multiple bindings for one
  action stack (§23 §3); each is its own record.

Pong binds P1 `Steer::Move` to `keys_axis(Key::W,Key::S)` and
`stick_y(Stick::Left)`, and P2 `Steer::Move` to `keys_axis(Key::Up,Key::Down)` and
`stick_y(Stick::Left)` — four binding records.

## 15. `[entrypoint]` — the runtime wiring (§07 §1, §14 §4)

Exactly one record for the selected entrypoint, lifting
`funpack_configs/entrypoints.fcfg` (§14 §4): the pipeline ↔ tick ↔ bindings
wiring that a pipeline carries **no** configuration for (§07 §1 — wiring lives in
the entrypoint, never the pipeline):

```
entrypoint NAME pipeline:PIPELINE tick_hz:HZ bindings:BINDINGS
```

- `NAME` is the entrypoint block label (`main`).
- `pipeline:PIPELINE` is the root pipeline (`Pong`) whose flattened order is
  §11.
- `tick_hz:HZ` is the fixed tick rate as an integer Hz (`60` for `60hz`). There
  are no multi-rate ticks (§07 §1); this is the single top-level tick.
- `bindings:BINDINGS` names the `bindings` function (§14, §23) whose resolved
  table is §14's `[bindings]`.

`net:` topology (§25) is absent for pong; when present it would add a
`net:TOPOLOGY` field — its absence is the no-netcode capability (§14 §4 derives
the capability set; no `net:` ⇒ netcode off), and adding the field bumps the
schema version (§1).

## 16. Parsing recipe (runtime, zero funpack imports)

A runtime parses an artifact thus, reading top-to-bottom, never seeking:

1. Read line 1; split on space; assert literal `funpack-artifact` and the integer
   version equals the runtime's built-for version, else **refuse** (§1).
2. For each section in the §3 fixed order: read the `[name N]` header, parse `N`,
   read the section body up to the next `[` header, and split it into `N`
   top-level records using the **single lead-line discipline** (§2.1) — a record
   spans its lead line up to the next lead line. Lead lines are those whose
   leading keyword is *not* in the closed sub-record keyword set (`variant`,
   `field`, `gtag`, `param`, `emit`, `producer`, `consumer`, `set`, `node`). This
   is the **only** parse discipline; the format does not promise a
   second grammar-only reader that derives `N` from declared sub-counts (it cannot
   be sound where a record carries an uncounted run, e.g. a `const`'s body `node`
   lines). Assert the lead-line count equals `N` or **refuse** (§29-style
   exact-match).
3. Within each record, decode each field by its **position** in the record's
   documented signature: a `Fixed` is the raw decimal `i64` (§2.3), an `Int` is
   decimal (§2.2), a `String` is `Lk:bytes` (§2.4), a name is a bare token (§2.6).
   Shape the record's sub-records using its declared scalar counts (`variant_count`,
   `param_count`, `emits_count`, `body_count`); read each body `node` run (§2.7) as
   a pre-order tree, consuming exactly each node's declared `child_count`.
4. Build the in-memory game model (enums, data/signal/thing schemas, function
   bodies, behaviors with their step bodies, the flattened pipeline, the routing
   map, the spawn batch, the binding table, the entrypoint) and interpret the
   carried checked-AST nodes per the §09 canonical semantics.

Because every section's `N` is the lead-line count, every record shapes its
sub-records by declared scalar counts, every body `node` declares its `child_count`,
and every field is positionally typed and length-explicit, the parse is total and
the byte layout is unambiguous. No `funpack` source is needed — this document is
the whole contract, bodies included.
